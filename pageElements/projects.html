        O_Robot: A MSP432-based differential drive robot 
	</div>
	<div class="module content">
			<p class="projectDescription" >
                In this project, I modeled a differential drive robots using nested <code>C</code> structs. Then, I used PID controllers to develop basic robotic behaviors such as go-to-goal and obstacles
                avoidance.  I used TI RSLK an MSP432-based robot. O_Robot senses the world through three infrared sensors. <br>
                This project can be used for educational purposes such teaching (i) differential drive robot kinematics, (ii) translation between different frame of references, (iii) basic control theory.

        R_Car: Raspberry Pi Remotely Controlled Car with Object Detection   
	</div>
	<div class="module content">
			<p class="projectDescription" >
                In this project I developed a Raspberry pi based robot car that can detect and classify objects. For that it uses SSD Mobilenet which is trained on the COCO dataset. 
                The code is written in <code>Python</code> using single and multiple processes approaches. The car is controlled by a Joystick via a bluetooth connection. <br>
                The project can be used for educational purposes such as teaching (i) realtime systems, (ii) basic deep learning concepts, and (iii) some basic concepts in robotics.
