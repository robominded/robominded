<p>	
A feedforward neural network is a type of neural network that is composed of layers of connected neurons, with each layer passing its output to the next layer. The connections between the neurons in a feedforward neural network are not connected in a cycle, which means that information flows only in one direction: from the input layer through the hidden layers and to the output layer.
</p><br>
<p>	
The basic building block of a feedforward neural network is the neuron, which is a simple computational unit that takes in a number of inputs, performs a computation on them, and produces a single output. In a feedforward neural network, each neuron receives input from multiple other neurons in the previous layer, and each neuron sends its output to multiple neurons in the next layer.
</p><br>
<p>	
The input layer of a feedforward neural network is responsible for receiving the raw data that the network will process. This data is passed through to the next layer, known as the hidden layer, which applies a set of transformations to the data in order to extract useful features. The hidden layer may consist of multiple neurons, each of which is responsible for extracting a different set of features.
</p><br>
<p>	
The final layer of a feedforward neural network is the output layer, which produces a prediction or decision based on the features extracted by the hidden layers. The output layer may consist of multiple neurons, each of which produces a different output. For example, in a classification task, the output layer may have one neuron for each possible class, with the neuron that produces the highest output indicating the predicted class.
</p><br>
<p>	
Training a feedforward neural network involves adjusting the weights and biases of the connections between the neurons in order to improve the network's ability to make accurate predictions or decisions. This is typically done using a variant of gradient descent, which is an optimization algorithm that adjusts the weights and biases in a way that minimizes the error between the predicted outputs and the desired outputs.
</p><br>
<p>	
One of the key advantages of feedforward neural networks is that they are relatively simple and easy to understand, which makes them a good starting point for learning about neural networks. However, they also have some limitations, such as the fact that they cannot process data in real-time, and they cannot handle inputs with complex relationships between each other. Despite these limitations, feedforward neural networks are still widely used and have achieved impressive results on a variety of tasks.

<div class="sectionHeader headerTextColor"> ANN with Code Examples </div>
A feedforward neural network is a type of neural network that consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The nodes in the input layer receive input data and pass it through the hidden layers, where it is transformed by a series of weights and biases. The output of the hidden layers is then passed through the output layer to produce a prediction.
<br>
Here is an example of a simple feedforward neural network implemented in PyTorch:
<pre><code class="python">import torch

# Define the model
model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(10, 32),  # Input layer
    torch.nn.ReLU(),  # Activation function
    torch.nn.Linear(32, 64),  # Hidden layer
    torch.nn.ReLU(),  # Activation function
    torch.nn.Linear(64, 10)  # Output layer
)

# Define the input data
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Compute the output of the model
output = model(input_data)

</code></pre>

In this example, we define a feedforward neural network with 10 input units, one hidden layer with 32 units, and an output layer with 10 units. We then apply the model to some random input data and compute the output.
<br>
Note that the output of a feedforward neural network is a tensor with the same shape as the output layer. In this case, the output has shape 1 x 10, because we used a batch size of 1 and the output layer has 10 units.
<br>
After defining the model, you can train it using the same steps as for any other neural network: define a loss function, define an optimizer, and loop over the training data, computing the output and loss, computing the gradients, and updating the model's parameters.
<br>
Here is an example of training a feedforward neural network:
<pre><code class="python">import torch

    # Define the model
    model = torch.nn.Sequential(
        torch.nn.Linear(10, 32),  # Input layer
        torch.nn.ReLU(),  # Activation function
        torch.nn.Linear(32, 64),  # Hidden layer
        torch.nn.ReLU(),  # Activation function
        torch.nn.Linear(64, 10)  # Output layer
    )
    
    # Define the loss function
    loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss()
    
    # Define the optimizer
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)
    
    # Define the training data
    inputs = torch.randn(100, 10)
    targets = torch.randn(100, 10)
    
    # Training loop
    for i in range(100):
        # Compute the output of the model
        output = model(inputs)
    
        # Compute the loss
        loss = loss_fn(output, targets)
    
        # Zero the gradients of the model
        optimizer.zero_grad()
    
        # Compute the gradients of the model
        loss.backward()
    
        # Update the model's parameters
        optimizer.step()
    
</code></pre>
In this example, we define a feedforward neural network and a mean squared error loss function. We then generate some random training data and train the model by looping over the training data, computing the output and loss, computing the gradients, and
