<p>		
Agile methodologies are a set of values and principles for software development that focus on delivering high-quality, working software quickly and efficiently.
They are based on the idea of iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing and cross-functional teams.
Agile methodologies are designed to be flexible and responsive to change, and they place a strong emphasis on teamwork, communication, and customer satisfaction.
Some of the most popular agile methodologies include: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Scrum, which is designed for teams of all sizes. It is based on the concept of a "sprint," which is a short, time-boxed period (usually 2-4 weeks) in which a cross-functional team works together to complete a specific set of tasks or deliverables. Scrum teams use a set of defined roles, events, and artifacts to plan, manage, and track their work, and they strive to continuously improve their processes through a practice known as "inspect and adapt."
    </li>
    <li>
        Kanban, which focuses on visualizing and managing the flow of work. It is based on the idea of using a "kanban board" to track tasks and visualize their progress through different stages of the development process. This allows teams to quickly see where bottlenecks or delays are occurring, and take corrective action to improve their flow of work.
    </li>
    <li>
        Lean, which is based on the principles of lean manufacturing, which is a system for maximizing value and minimizing waste. In the context of software development, lean teams focus on reducing waste, increasing efficiency, and delivering value to the customer as quickly as possible. They do this by applying lean principles such as identifying and eliminating waste, maximizing flow, and continuously improving their processes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Extreme Programming (XP), which is an agile methodology that is focused on delivering high-quality software quickly and efficiently. It is based on a set of values and practices that prioritize customer satisfaction, teamwork, and communication. XP teams use a variety of techniques such as test-driven development, continuous integration, and pair programming to produce high-quality software in short, iterative cycles.
    </li>

</ul>
