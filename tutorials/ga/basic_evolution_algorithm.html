    <p>
    Evolution algorithms, also known as evolutionary algorithms, are a subset of artificial intelligence that are inspired by the process of natural selection. They are a type of optimization algorithm that uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, and selection, to find solutions to problems. Evolution algorithms are often used in machine learning and other fields to find the best possible solutions to complex problems.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    There are several different types of evolution algorithms, including genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, and evolutionary strategies. These algorithms typically involve several key steps, including:
  </p><br>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Initialization: In this step, a population of potential solutions to the problem is created. These solutions, also known as individuals or chromosomes, are typically represented as strings of binary digits or other data structures.
    </li>
    <li>
      Evaluation: In this step, each individual in the population is evaluated according to a predefined fitness function. This function measures how well each individual solves the problem, and determines which individuals are more likely to be selected for reproduction.
    </li>
    <li>
      Selection: In this step, the fittest individuals from the population are selected to reproduce and create a new generation of individuals. The selection process typically involves some form of "survival of the fittest," where the fittest individuals are more likely to be selected for reproduction.
    </li>
    <li>
      Crossover: In this step, pairs of selected individuals are combined to produce offspring that inherit characteristics from both parents. This is typically done using a crossover operator, which randomly selects bits from each parent to create the offspring.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mutation: In this step, random changes, or mutations, are introduced into the population to introduce new diversity and prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in a local optimum.
    </li>
    <li>
      Repeat: These steps are repeated for a predefined number of generations or until a satisfactory solution is found.
    </li>
  </ol>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Here is an example of a simple evolution algorithm implemented in Python:

		
<div class="sectionHeader headerTextColor"> Non-Vectorized Implementation </div>

<pre> <code class="python">import random

err = 0.0001 # if a candidate solution is within `acc` from the true solution
            # then it is good enough and the search should be terminated
population_size = 10000
survivors_percentage = 0.01
mutation_value = 0.01 # specify by how much candidate solutions should be 
                      # mutated to generate new solutions

# function to optimize
def foo(x, y, z):
  return 6*x**3 + 9*y**2 + 90*z - 51

def fitness(x,y,z):
  '''
  The fitness function assigns a value to a candidate solution indicating its 
  quality (how good this candidate solution is).
  '''
  diff = foo(x,y,z)
  # The fitness is the reciprocal of the returned value
  return 1/(abs(diff)+1e-7)

## Initialization

    elements.append(s[1][0])

  # generate a new population (or generation) by mutating the best solutions
  # from the previous generation
