         O_Robot: A MSP432-based differential drive robot 
	</div>
	<div class="module content">
			<p class="projectDescription" >
                In this project, I modeled a differential drive robots using nested <code>C</code> structs. Then, I used PID controllers to develop basic robotic behaviors such as go-to-goal and obstacles
                avoidance.  I used TI RSLK an MSP432-based robot. O_Robot senses the world through three infrared sensors. <br>
                This project can be used for educational purposes such teaching (i) differential drive robot kinematics, (ii) translation between different frame of references, (iii) basic control theory.

        R_Car: Raspberry Pi Remotely Controlled Car with Object Detection   
	</div>
	<div class="module content">
			<p class="projectDescription" >
                In this project I developed a Raspberry pi based robot car that can detect and classify objects. For that it uses SSD Mobilenet which is trained on the COCO dataset. 
                The code is written in <code>Python</code> using single and multiple processes approaches. The car is controlled by a Joystick via a bluetooth connection. <br>
                The project can be used for educational purposes such as teaching (i) realtime systems, (ii) basic deep learning concepts, and (iii) some basic concepts in robotics.

		<p class="projectDescription">
			In this work, we introduce a compound vision algorithm that doubles the effective range of Intel RealSense depth camera. 
			And, we propose a robust navigation stack that combines Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and the probabilistic localization method AMCL.

		Deep Reinforcement Learning VS Evolution Strategies: A Comparative Survey
	</div>
	<div class="module content">
		<p class="projectDescription">
			Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Evolution Strategies (ESs) have surpassed human-level control 
			in many sequential decision-making problems, yet many open challenges still exist. To get insights 
			into the strengths and weaknesses of DRL versus ESs, an analysis of their respective capabilities 
			and limitations is provided. After presenting their fundamental concepts and algorithms, a comparison 
			is provided on key aspects such as scalability, exploration, adaptation to dynamic environments, and 
			multi-agent learning. Key current research challenges ...

		Lightweight Audio Source Localization for Swarm Robots
	</div>
	<div class="module content">
		<img class="projectImage" src="images/audioCar.jpeg">
		<p class="projectDescription">
		The ability to localize a sound source is essential for safe integration of robots in our society.
		However, its high computational demand makes it challenging to equip small swarm robots with such capability. 
		Therefore, this paper investigates potential means for developing a lightweight sound source localization method. It introduces 
		the Cutting The Plane (CTP) algorithm which leverages recent advancements in embedded microphone technology to reduce 
		the computation complexity of audio source localization. We analyzed its performance and compared it to a software-based approach using simulation. Finally, we performed tests on real hardware to show the feasibility of using our system for relative localization between swarm robots.

		Batteryless Swarm Robots
	</div>
	<div class="module content">
			<p class="projectDescription" >
			Tiny robots can be used for different applications such as surveillance and search and rescue operations. 
			However, these robots have limited operation time due their limited energy storage.
			In this workØŒ we drop batteries and use renewable energy instead.
			Using solar energy to power tiny robots makes them operate <i>intermittently</i> but for unlimited period of time. 
			The developed light-powered battery-free robot uses non-volatile memory to save the movement progress across power failures.
			The robot shows minimal increased deviation from its instructed path when compared to its battery powered equivalent.
